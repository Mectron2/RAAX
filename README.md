# RAAX
For the annoying server owners that add an Anti-Xray plugin

# Important note regarding original creator
**RAAX is a fork** of the `https://github.com/tokfrans03/AntiAntiXray` repository, which is also a fork where the commit author is one ConstantinDev.
The algorithms used in this mod are not written from scratch, but their authorship is unfortunately not known. That's all I know.
The original mod was written for 1.16.4, **RAAX works on 1.21.6**, in the future I will add support for older versions and rewrite all legacy code, thanks for your understanding!

## Installing
1. Download the newest version from releases
2. Put it into your `mods` folder in your fabric installation
3. Install the Fabric API
4. That's it :)

## Usage
To scan nearby blocks in selected radius, press `G` ingame.
To turn on X-ray, press `X` (WIP, it's better to off smooth lighting).
To clear block highlighting, press `N`.
All bindings can be changed and looked at in the settings

## Commands
All commands can be viewed using `:help` or `:?`
